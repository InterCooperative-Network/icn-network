In onion routing, a pre-established path through multiple nodes for private communication.

**Clearing**  
The process of settling balances between federations or accounts to reduce gross obligations to net obligations.

**Commitment**  
A cryptographic primitive that allows committing to a value while keeping it hidden, used in confidential transactions.

**Confidential Transaction**  
A transaction where the amount is hidden using zero-knowledge proofs while ensuring the transaction is valid.

**Consensus**  
The process by which nodes in the network agree on the state of the system.

**Cooperative**  
An autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet common economic, social, and cultural needs through jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise.

The ICN subsystem that handles mutual credit, transactions, and resource exchange between cooperatives.

**Edge Node**  
A node operating at the network periphery, often with limited resources but providing local connectivity.

## F

**Federation**  
A group of cooperatives that share a common namespace, governance, and trust relationships, forming a cooperative network.

**Federation Exchange**  
The system that enables economic activity between different federations.

## G

**Governance**  
The system of rules, practices, and processes by which cooperatives are directed and controlled.

**Governance VM**  
The virtual machine that executes governance policies in a secure, sandboxed environment.

## I

The complete system described in this documentation, comprising all subsystems and components.

**Identity System**  
The subsystem responsible for DIDs, credentials, and privacy-preserving identity verification.

## K

**Key Rotation**  
The periodic changing of cryptographic keys to mitigate the risk of key compromise.

## M

**Mesh Network**  
A network topology where nodes connect directly to as many other nodes as possible, enabling resilient local connectivity.

**Mutual Credit**  
A non-speculative economic system where credit is created when an account goes negative, balanced by another account going positive.

## N

**Network Layer**  
The subsystem handling communication between nodes, including transport security, overlay networking, and mesh capabilities.

**Node**  
A participant in the ICN network that implements one or more ICN subsystems.

## O

**Onion Routing**  
A technique for anonymous communication where messages are encrypted in layers, like an onion.

**Overlay Network**  
A virtual network built on top of existing network infrastructure, enabling ICN-specific routing and addressing.

**OverlayAddress**  
A unique identifier for a node in the overlay network, often mapped to a DID.

## P

**Path Transaction**  
A transaction that flows through multiple credit lines to reach its destination.

**Pedersen Commitment**  
A cryptographic commitment scheme used in confidential transactions to hide amounts.

**Post-Quantum Cryptography**  
Cryptographic algorithms believed to be secure against attacks by quantum computers.

**Privacy**  
The protection of information and identity in the ICN, implemented through zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, and secure multi-party computation.

## Q

**Quadratic Voting**  
A collective decision-making procedure where voting power scales as the square root of the number of votes, reducing the power of large stakeholders.

## R

**Range Proof**  
A zero-knowledge proof that a value lies within a specific range, used to prove transaction amounts are positive without revealing them.

**Reputation**  
A measure of trustworthiness in the ICN, affecting credit limits and governance weight.

**Resource**  
Any shareable asset managed by the ICN, including computing resources, storage, network, and physical assets.

**Resource Coordination System**  
The subsystem responsible for registering, allocating, and coordinating resources among cooperatives.

**Ring Signature**  
A cryptographic signature that specifies a group of possible signers without revealing which member actually produced the signature.

## S

**Secure Channel**  
An encrypted communication path between nodes, typically using TLS 1.3 or WireGuard.

**Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**  
A cryptographic technique allowing multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private.

**Security Domain**  
A classification for information and operations based on their security requirements.

**Selective Disclosure**  
The ability to reveal only specific attributes from a credential without exposing the entire credential.

**SNARK (Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge)**  
A form of zero-knowledge proof that is small in size and quick to verify.

**STARK (Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge)**  
A transparent, post-quantum secure zero-knowledge proof system.
