# ICN Network - Developer Documentation

## Overview

The ICN Network is a cooperative-based dual power infrastructure designed to operate alongside and eventually replace nation-state structures. This system empowers workers through democratic ownership and control of networked cooperatives, creating a resilient and equitable economic system.

## Core Components

### Economic System
- **Cooperative Federations**: Networks of worker-owned cooperatives
- **Resource Allocation**: Democratic planning through participatory budgeting
- **Asset Management**: Decentralized custody and rights management
- **Cross-Border Operations**: Transportation, logistics, and supply chain coordination

### Communication System
- **Secure Messaging**: End-to-end encrypted communication
- **Decision Support**: Tools for collective intelligence and voting
- **Knowledge Commons**: Shared resources and intellectual property
- **Emergency Response**: Coordination during disasters and crises

### Political Framework
- **Cooperative Governance**: Democratic decision-making structures
- **Liquid Democracy**: Flexible delegation of voting power
- **Quadratic Voting**: Weighted preference system for equitable decisions
- **Dispute Resolution**: Non-state arbitration and mediation processes
- **Worker Mobility**: Cross-border movement support system
- **Refugee Support**: Humanitarian aid and integration into cooperative systems

## Architecture

The ICN system uses a decentralized architecture built on:

1. **Blockchain Technology**: For transparent, tamper-proof record-keeping
2. **Federated Systems**: For balancing local autonomy with global coordination
3. **End-to-End Encryption**: For secure communication and data protection
4. **Peer-to-Peer Networks**: For resilient infrastructure without central points of failure
5. **Open Standards**: For interoperability across different cooperative systems

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
The codebase is organized into the following main directories:
- `/core` - Core system functionality and interfaces
- `/economic` - Economic management systems
- `/political` - Political framework and governance systems
- `/communication` - Messaging and coordination tools
- `/infrastructure` - Network and physical infrastructure coordination
- `/security` - Security and authentication systems
- `/clients` - Client applications for various platforms

### Key Interfaces

#### Economic Engine
The Economic Engine manages resource allocation and coordination between cooperatives.
See `economic-engine.rs` for implementation details.

#### Political Engine
The Political Engine handles governance, decision-making, and dispute resolution.
See `political-framework.rs` for implementation details.

#### Communication Hub
The Communication Hub provides secure messaging and coordination.
See `communication-hub.rs` for implementation details.
