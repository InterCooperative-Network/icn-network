## Milestone Dependencies

Understanding the dependencies between milestones is crucial for planning development work.

Key Dependencies:
- Identity System (1.2) is required for most other components
- Networking Layer (1.3) is required for all distributed functionality
- Consensus Engine (1.4, 2.1, 3.1) undergirds transaction handling in Economic System (2.4, 3.3)
- Governance DSL (2.3) must be implemented before Governance VM (3.2)
- Privacy Suite (4.2) enhances several earlier components

## Risk Factors & Contingencies

Each milestone has associated risks and contingency plans:

1. **Cryptography Implementation Complexity**
   - Risk: ZKP and advanced cryptography may prove more complex than estimated
   - Contingency: Prioritize simpler privacy mechanisms first, develop iteratively

2. **Scalability Challenges**
   - Risk: DAG consensus may not scale as expected under real-world conditions
   - Contingency: Implement sharding and hierarchical consensus as backup approaches

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Risk: Supporting diverse hardware from servers to embedded devices may be challenging
   - Contingency: Develop tiered feature sets with progressive enhancement

4. **Adoption Barriers**
   - Risk: Complex features may create barriers to adoption
   - Contingency: Focus on usability and documentation, develop transition tools

5. **Regulatory Considerations**
   - Risk: Varying regulations may affect deployment in some regions
   - Contingency: Design with regulatory configurability to meet local requirements
