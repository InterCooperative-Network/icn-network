# Political Framework Implementation Guide

## Overview

The ICN Network's political framework provides a cooperative governance system designed to operate in parallel with, and eventually replace, nation-state political structures. This framework is built on principles of democracy, worker empowerment, and cross-border solidarity.

## Key Components

### Cooperative Assemblies

Cooperative Assemblies are the primary decision-making bodies within the ICN political framework:

```rust
pub struct CooperativeAssembly {
    id: String,
    name: String,
    description: String,
    member_federations: HashSet<String>,  // Federation IDs
    delegates: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>, // Federation ID -> Delegate DIDs
    active_proposals: HashMap<String, Proposal>,
    passed_proposals: HashMap<String, Proposal>,
    rejected_proposals: HashMap<String, Proposal>,
    voting_system: VotingSystem,
    committees: HashMap<String, Committee>,
}
```

Assemblies manage:
- Cross-federation decision making
- Policy approval
- Resource allocation decisions
- Dispute resolution between federations

### Delegate System

The delegate system uses liquid democracy to provide flexible representation:

```rust
pub struct Delegate {
    did: String,
    federation_id: String,
    delegated_power: f64,  // Quadratic voting power
    specializations: Vec<PolicyDomain>,
    voting_record: HashMap<String, Vote>, // Proposal ID -> Vote
    contributions: Vec<Contribution>,
    reputation_score: f64,
}

pub struct DelegationChain {
    original_delegator: String, // DID of original voter
    current_delegate: String,   // DID of current delegate
    policy_domain: Option<PolicyDomain>, // If domain-specific
    delegation_timestamp: u64,
    revocable: bool,
    expiration: Option<u64>,
}
```

Delegation features:
- Domain-specific delegation (e.g., delegate for environmental issues only)
- Revocable delegation
- Time-limited delegation
- Transparent voting records

### Proposal System

Proposals are the mechanism for formal decision-making:

```rust
pub struct Proposal {
    id: String,
    title: String,
    description: String,
    proposal_type: ProposalType,
    author_did: String,
    federation_id: String,
    created_at: u64,
    status: ProposalStatus,
    votes: HashMap<String, Vote>, // DID -> Vote
    implementation_status: ImplementationStatus,
    affected_cooperatives: Vec<String>,
    impact_assessment: ImpactAssessment,
}

pub enum ProposalType {
    LaborRights,
    ResourceAllocation,
    DisputeResolution,
    SecurityProtocol,
    RefugeeMobility,
    EconomicPolicy,
    FederationMembership,
    LegalFramework,
    EnvironmentalStandard,
    TechnologyAdoption,
}
```

Key proposal features:
- Categorization by policy domain
- Impact assessment requirements
- Status tracking from draft to implementation
- Federation-specific or global scope

### Quadratic Voting

The voting system uses quadratic voting to prevent power concentration:

```rust
pub struct Vote {
    voter_did: String,
    federation_id: String,
    vote_type: VoteType,
    weight: f64,  // Raw voting power
    quadratic_weight: f64, // Square root of weight for quadratic voting
    rationale: Option<String>,
    timestamp: u64,
    signature: String, // Cryptographic proof
}
```

Quadratic voting implementation:
- Raw voting power is the square of the quadratic weight
- Prevents large federations from dominating smaller ones
- Allows expression of preference intensity
- Cryptographically secured voting records

## Security Framework

The security framework maintains democratic control of enforcement mechanisms:

```rust
pub struct SecurityProtocol {
    id: String,
    name: String,
    description: String,
    security_teams: HashMap<String, SecurityTeam>, // Federation ID -> Team
    active_incidents: HashMap<String, SecurityIncident>,
    resolved_incidents: HashMap<String, SecurityIncident>,
    response_procedures: HashMap<IncidentType, ResponseProcedure>,
}

pub struct SecurityTeam {
    federation_id: String,
    members: Vec<String>, // DIDs
    reputation_score: f64,
    jurisdiction: Vec<String>, // Areas of responsibility
    democratic_oversight: OversightMechanism,
}
```

Key security features:
- Democratic oversight of all security teams
- Regular review and accountability
- Transparent incident reporting
- Cross-federation coordination of response

## Worker and Refugee Mobility

The mobility system provides support for workers and refugees moving between federations:

```rust
pub struct MobilityPassport {
    holder_did: String,
    issuer_federation: String,
    passport_type: PassportType,
    status: PassportStatus,
    issued_at: u64,
    valid_until: u64,
    authorized_federations: HashSet<String>,
    skills: Vec<String>,
    endorsements: HashMap<String, Endorsement>, // Federation ID -> Endorsement
    movement_history: Vec<MovementRecord>,
    rights_guarantees: Vec<RightsGuarantee>,
}

pub enum PassportType {
    Worker,
    Refugee,
    Delegate,
    SecurityTeam,
}

pub struct RightsGuarantee {
    right_type: RightType,
    description: String,
    enforcement_mechanism: String,
    appeal_process: String,
}
```

Key mobility features:
- Rights guarantees that follow the person
- Skills recognition across federations
- Streamlined relocation support
- Special protections for refugees

## Legal Framework

The cooperative legal framework operates in parallel to state legal systems:

```rust
pub struct LegalFramework {
    id: String,
    name: String,
    principles: Vec<LegalPrinciple>,
    dispute_resolution: DisputeResolutionSystem,
    precedents: HashMap<String, LegalPrecedent>,
    enforcement_mechanisms: Vec<EnforcementMechanism>,
}

pub struct DisputeResolutionSystem {
    methods: Vec<DisputeMethod>,
    arbiters: HashMap<String, Arbiter>, // DID -> Arbiter info
    appeal_process: AppealProcess,
    transparency_requirements: TransparencyRequirement,
}

pub enum DisputeMethod {
    Mediation,
    Arbitration,
    PeerJury,
    ExpertPanel,
    ConsensusCircle,
}
```

Key legal features:
- Non-state binding arbitration
- Peer-based dispute resolution
- Precedent-based consistency
- Multiple resolution methods for different contexts

## Implementation Guidelines

### Adding a New Assembly

```rust
// Create a new assembly
let assembly = CooperativeAssembly {
    id: "global-coordination-assembly".to_string(),
    name: "Global Coordination Assembly".to_string(),
    description: "Handles cross-federation coordination and global policy".to_string(),
    member_federations: ["federation1", "federation2", "federation3"].iter().map(|s| s.to_string()).collect(),
    delegates: HashMap::new(), // Will be populated with elected delegates
    active_proposals: HashMap::new(),
    passed_proposals: HashMap::new(),
    rejected_proposals: HashMap::new(),
    voting_system: VotingSystem::Quadratic,
    committees: HashMap::new(),
};

// Add to the political engine
political_engine.create_assembly(assembly)?;
```

### Creating and Voting on Proposals

```rust
// Create a new proposal
let proposal = Proposal {
    id: generate_unique_id(),
    title: "Universal Basic Services Standard".to_string(),
    description: "Establish minimum standards for services provided to all members".to_string(),
    proposal_type: ProposalType::LaborRights,
    author_did: "did:icn:author123",
    federation_id: "federation1",
    created_at: current_timestamp(),
    status: ProposalStatus::Proposed,
    votes: HashMap::new(),
    implementation_status: ImplementationStatus::NotStarted,
    affected_cooperatives: vec!["healthcare-coop-1", "housing-coop-3"],
    impact_assessment: ImpactAssessment::High {
        description: "Affects fundamental rights guarantees".to_string(),
        affected_areas: vec!["healthcare", "housing", "education"],
    },
};

// Submit proposal to an assembly
let proposal_id = political_engine.submit_proposal("global-coordination-assembly", proposal)?;

// Cast a vote on the proposal
let vote = Vote {
    voter_did: "did:icn:delegate456".to_string(),
    federation_id: "federation2".to_string(),
    vote_type: VoteType::Approve,
    weight: 4.0, // Raw voting power
    quadratic_weight: 0.0, // Will be calculated by the engine
    rationale: Some("This establishes important baseline protections".to_string()),
    timestamp: current_timestamp(),
    signature: sign_vote(proposal_id, "did:icn:delegate456", VoteType::Approve),
};

political_engine.cast_vote("global-coordination-assembly", &proposal_id, vote)?;
```

### Security Team Management

```rust
// Create a security team with democratic oversight
let team = SecurityTeam {
    federation_id: "federation3".to_string(),
    members: vec!["did:icn:security001", "did:icn:security002"],
    reputation_score: 0.95,
    jurisdiction: vec!["digital-infrastructure", "physical-infrastructure"],
    democratic_oversight: OversightMechanism {
        oversight_committee: "security-oversight-committee".to_string(),
        review_period: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days in seconds
        transparency_level: TransparencyLevel::High,
        appeal_process: Some("appeal-to-assembly".to_string()),
    },
};

political_engine.create_security_team("main-security-protocol", team)?;
```

### Issuing Mobility Passports

```rust
// Create a mobility passport for a refugee
let passport = MobilityPassport {
    holder_did: "did:icn:refugee789".to_string(),
    issuer_federation: "federation1".to_string(),
    passport_type: PassportType::Refugee,
    status: PassportStatus::Active,
    issued_at: current_timestamp(),
    valid_until: current_timestamp() + (365 * 24 * 60 * 60), // Valid for 1 year
    authorized_federations: ["federation1", "federation2", "federation3", "federation4"]
        .iter().map(|s| s.to_string()).collect(),
    skills: vec!["carpentry", "electrical", "plumbing"],
    endorsements: HashMap::new(), // Will be populated as federations endorse
    movement_history: Vec::new(),
    rights_guarantees: vec![
        RightsGuarantee {
            right_type: RightType::Housing,
            description: "Access to safe, quality housing".to_string(),
            enforcement_mechanism: "housing-appeal-committee".to_string(),
            appeal_process: "appeal-to-assembly".to_string(),
        },
        RightsGuarantee {
            right_type: RightType::Healthcare,
            description: "Access to comprehensive healthcare".to_string(),
            enforcement_mechanism: "healthcare-committee".to_string(),
            appeal_process: "appeal-to-assembly".to_string(),
        },
    ],
};

political_engine.issue_mobility_passport(passport)?;
```

## Integration with Economic System

The political framework integrates with the economic engine for:

1. **Resource Allocation**: Proposals can trigger economic resource distribution
2. **Membership Management**: Federation membership reflects in economic participation
3. **Rights Enforcement**: Economic benefits tied to rights guarantees
4. **Participatory Budgeting**: Political decisions drive budget allocations

## Integration with Communication System

The political framework uses the communication system for:

1. **Secure Voting**: Encrypted vote transmission
2. **Proposal Discussion**: Structured debate platforms
3. **Emergency Coordination**: Crisis response communication
4. **Public Transparency**: Open access to decision records

## Testing

When testing the political framework, focus on:

1. **Consensus Mechanisms**: Verify proper vote counting and proposal execution
2. **Security Controls**: Ensure democratic oversight prevents abuse
3. **Rights Enforcement**: Test mobility passport rights guarantees
4. **Integration Tests**: Verify interoperation with economic and communication systems

## Performance Considerations

The political framework should be optimized for:

1. **Scalability**: Must handle millions of participants
2. **Low Latency**: Critical for emergency response
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Must continue operating during infrastructure disruptions
4. **Decentralization**: Avoid single points of failure or control

## Conclusion

The ICN political framework provides a cooperative alternative to nation-state politics while ensuring that power remains democratically controlled. When implementing or extending this system, maintain these core principles:

1. **Democratic Control**: All power must be accountable to membership
2. **Transparency**: Decision processes must be open and auditable
3. **Rights Protection**: Individual rights must be guaranteed and enforced
4. **Solidarity**: System must promote cross-border cooperation
5. **Resilience**: Framework must withstand attacks and disruptions
