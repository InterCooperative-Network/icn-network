# Identity-Integrated Storage System

The ICN Network has been enhanced with an Identity-Integrated Storage System that combines the strengths of decentralized identity (DID), governance-controlled policies, and secure storage to create a user-centric, secure, and democratically managed data storage solution.

## System Overview

The Identity-Integrated Storage System builds upon our previously implemented secure storage and governance systems by adding a robust identity layer for authentication and access control. This integration achieves several key objectives:

1. **DID-Based Authentication**: Users can authenticate to the storage system using their decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and cryptographic signatures, eliminating reliance on centralized authentication services.

2. **Integration with Governance**: The system leverages the existing governance framework to enforce access control policies while adding identity-specific capabilities.

3. **Key Rotation Support**: Users can update their DID documents and keys while maintaining access to their resources, enhancing security without disruption.

4. **Federation Member Mapping**: DIDs are mapped to federation member IDs for seamless integration with existing governance policies.

5. **Challenge-Response Authentication**: Secure challenge-response mechanisms protect against replay attacks and ensure only authorized DIDs can access protected resources.

## Core Components

### IdentityProvider

A trait that defines the interface for resolving DIDs, verifying signatures, and maintaining DID-to-member mappings:

```rust
pub trait IdentityProvider {
    async fn resolve_did(&self, did: &str) -> Result<Option<DidDocument>>;
    async fn verify_signature(&self, did: &str, message: &[u8], signature: &[u8]) -> Result<DidVerificationStatus>;
    async fn get_member_id_for_did(&self, did: &str) -> Result<Option<String>>;
}
```

### IdentityStorageService

The central service that integrates identity verification with storage operations:

```rust
pub struct IdentityStorageService<P: IdentityProvider> {
    federation: String,
    storage_path: PathBuf,
    identity_provider: P,
    governance_storage: GovernanceStorageService,
    auth_cache: HashMap<String, (Instant, String)>,
    cache_ttl: u64,
}
```

This service handles:
- DID authentication and signature verification
- Mapping DIDs to member IDs for policy enforcement
- Integrating with governance-controlled storage for permission checks
- Caching authentication results for performance optimization

### DID Document Structure

A simplified W3C-compliant DID document structure that includes:
- DID identifier
- Controller information
- Verification methods (cryptographic keys)
- Authentication methods
- Service endpoints

## CLI Commands

New CLI commands have been added to support identity-integrated storage operations:

- `icn-cli identity-storage init`: Initialize the identity storage environment
- `icn-cli identity-storage register-did`: Register a DID document for storage access
- `icn-cli identity-storage store-file`: Store a file with DID authentication
- `icn-cli identity-storage get-file`: Retrieve a file with DID authentication
- `icn-cli identity-storage list-files`: List files accessible to a DID
- `icn-cli identity-storage map-did-to-member`: Map a DID to a federation member ID
- `icn-cli identity-storage create-access-policy`: Create an access policy with DID authentication

## Security Features

The Identity-Integrated Storage System includes several security enhancements:

1. **Cryptographic Authentication**: All operations require cryptographic proof of DID control.
2. **Authentication Caching**: DID authentication results are cached with a configurable time-to-live (TTL) for performance optimization.
3. **Challenge-Response Protocol**: Prevents replay attacks by requiring signatures on unique challenges.
4. **Default-Deny Access Control**: Access is denied by default and only granted through explicit policies.
5. **Key Rotation Support**: Users can update their keys while maintaining access to their resources.

3. **Progressive Trust**: Implementing trust mechanisms based on DID interaction history.
4. **Identity Recovery**: Supporting DID recovery mechanisms for lost keys.
5. **Selective Disclosure**: Enabling selective disclosure of identity attributes for access control.

## Conclusion

The Identity-Integrated Storage System represents a significant advancement in the ICN Network's capabilities, providing a secure, user-centric approach to storage access control through the integration of decentralized identity. By combining DIDs, governance policies, and secure storage, we've created a system that enables fine-grained access control while maintaining user autonomy and privacy. 

# Credential-Based Storage System

The ICN Network has been further enhanced with a Credential-Based Storage System that extends our identity-integrated storage with attribute-based access control through verifiable credentials. This advancement enables more sophisticated and fine-grained authorization based on verified attributes rather than just identity.

## System Overview

The Credential-Based Storage System builds upon our identity-integrated storage by adding support for W3C Verifiable Credentials, allowing access control decisions based on attributes contained within these credentials. This integration achieves several key objectives:

1. **Attribute-Based Access Control**: Access permissions are granted based on verified attributes such as role, department, clearance level, or any other relevant credential data.

2. **Credential Verification**: Cryptographic verification ensures that credentials are authentic, issued by trusted entities, and have not been tampered with.

3. **Freshness Enforcement**: Automatic checking of credential expiration dates and revocation status ensures that access decisions are based on current information.

4. **Fine-Grained Access Rules**: Sophisticated rule matching based on credential types and attribute values enables precise access control policies.

5. **Federation-Governed Trust**: The democratic governance system determines which credential issuers are trusted within the federation.

## Core Components

### VerifiableCredential

A structure representing W3C-compliant verifiable credentials with claims about a subject:

```rust
pub struct VerifiableCredential {
    pub id: String,
    pub types: Vec<String>,
    pub issuer: String,
    pub issuance_date: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub expiration_date: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub credential_subject: CredentialSubject,
    pub proof: Proof,
    pub revocation_info: Option<RevocationInfo>,
}
```

### CredentialProvider

A trait that defines the interface for resolving and verifying credentials:

```rust
pub trait CredentialProvider {
    async fn resolve_credential(&self, credential_id: &str) -> Result<Option<VerifiableCredential>>;
    async fn verify_credential(&self, credential: &VerifiableCredential) -> Result<CredentialVerificationStatus>;
    async fn is_revoked(&self, credential: &VerifiableCredential) -> Result<bool>;
}
```

### CredentialStorageService

The central service that integrates credential verification with identity-based storage:

```rust
pub struct CredentialStorageService<P: CredentialProvider, I: IdentityProvider> {
    federation: String,
    storage_path: PathBuf,
    credential_provider: P,
    identity_storage: IdentityStorageService<I>,
    access_rules: Vec<CredentialAccessRule>,
}
```

This service handles:
- Credential verification and attribute checking
- Integrating with identity-based storage for DID authentication
- Enforcing access rules based on credential attributes
- Managing access rule persistence

### CredentialAccessRule

A structure defining access rules based on credential types and attributes:

```rust
pub struct CredentialAccessRule {
    pub pattern: String,
    pub credential_types: Vec<String>,
    pub attributes: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub permissions: Vec<Permission>,
}
```

## CLI Commands

New CLI commands have been added to support credential-based storage operations:

- `icn-cli credential-storage load-access-rules`: Load credential access rules from a file

## Security Features

The Credential-Based Storage System includes several security enhancements:

1. **Cryptographic Verification**: All credentials require cryptographic proof of authenticity via signatures.
2. **Expiration Enforcement**: Credentials with expired dates are automatically rejected.
3. **Revocation Checking**: The system checks if credentials have been revoked before granting access.
4. **Attribute Matching**: Fine-grained matching of credential attributes against access rules.
5. **Trust Framework**: Federation-governed decisions on which credential issuers to trust.
