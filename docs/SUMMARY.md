# Identity-Integrated Storage System

The ICN Network has been enhanced with an Identity-Integrated Storage System that combines the strengths of decentralized identity (DID), governance-controlled policies, and secure storage to create a user-centric, secure, and democratically managed data storage solution.

## System Overview

The Identity-Integrated Storage System builds upon our previously implemented secure storage and governance systems by adding a robust identity layer for authentication and access control. This integration achieves several key objectives:

1. **DID-Based Authentication**: Users can authenticate to the storage system using their decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and cryptographic signatures, eliminating reliance on centralized authentication services.

2. **Integration with Governance**: The system leverages the existing governance framework to enforce access control policies while adding identity-specific capabilities.

3. **Key Rotation Support**: Users can update their DID documents and keys while maintaining access to their resources, enhancing security without disruption.

4. **Federation Member Mapping**: DIDs are mapped to federation member IDs for seamless integration with existing governance policies.

5. **Challenge-Response Authentication**: Secure challenge-response mechanisms protect against replay attacks and ensure only authorized DIDs can access protected resources.

## Core Components

### IdentityProvider

A trait that defines the interface for resolving DIDs, verifying signatures, and maintaining DID-to-member mappings:

```rust
pub trait IdentityProvider {
    async fn resolve_did(&self, did: &str) -> Result<Option<DidDocument>>;
    async fn verify_signature(&self, did: &str, message: &[u8], signature: &[u8]) -> Result<DidVerificationStatus>;
    async fn get_member_id_for_did(&self, did: &str) -> Result<Option<String>>;
}
```

### IdentityStorageService

The central service that integrates identity verification with storage operations:

```rust
pub struct IdentityStorageService<P: IdentityProvider> {
    federation: String,
    storage_path: PathBuf,
    identity_provider: P,
    governance_storage: GovernanceStorageService,
    auth_cache: HashMap<String, (Instant, String)>,
    cache_ttl: u64,
}
```

This service handles:
- DID authentication and signature verification
- Mapping DIDs to member IDs for policy enforcement
- Integrating with governance-controlled storage for permission checks
- Caching authentication results for performance optimization

### DID Document Structure

A simplified W3C-compliant DID document structure that includes:
- DID identifier
- Controller information
- Verification methods (cryptographic keys)
- Authentication methods
- Service endpoints

## CLI Commands

New CLI commands have been added to support identity-integrated storage operations:

- `icn-cli identity-storage init`: Initialize the identity storage environment
- `icn-cli identity-storage register-did`: Register a DID document for storage access
- `icn-cli identity-storage store-file`: Store a file with DID authentication
- `icn-cli identity-storage get-file`: Retrieve a file with DID authentication
- `icn-cli identity-storage list-files`: List files accessible to a DID
- `icn-cli identity-storage map-did-to-member`: Map a DID to a federation member ID
- `icn-cli identity-storage create-access-policy`: Create an access policy with DID authentication

## Security Features

The Identity-Integrated Storage System includes several security enhancements:

1. **Cryptographic Authentication**: All operations require cryptographic proof of DID control.
2. **Authentication Caching**: DID authentication results are cached with a configurable time-to-live (TTL) for performance optimization.
3. **Challenge-Response Protocol**: Prevents replay attacks by requiring signatures on unique challenges.
4. **Default-Deny Access Control**: Access is denied by default and only granted through explicit policies.
5. **Key Rotation Support**: Users can update their keys while maintaining access to their resources.

## Demo Script

A comprehensive demonstration script (`examples/identity_storage_demo.sh`) has been created to showcase the capabilities of the identity-integrated storage system, including:

- Creating and registering DID documents
- Mapping DIDs to member IDs
- Creating access control policies
- Storing and retrieving files with DID authentication
- Demonstrating policy updates and their effects
- Showcasing key rotation capabilities

## Documentation

Detailed documentation has been added in `docs/storage/identity-integrated-storage.md`, covering:
- System architecture and components
- DID authentication process
- Key component descriptions
- Usage examples
- Security considerations
- Advanced features
- Future extensions

The main README.md has also been updated to reflect the new identity-integrated storage capabilities.

## Future Extensions

Planned extensions for the Identity-Integrated Storage System include:

1. **Verifiable Credentials**: Integrating verifiable credentials for attribute-based access control.
2. **DID Federation**: Supporting cross-federation DID authentication.
3. **Progressive Trust**: Implementing trust mechanisms based on DID interaction history.
4. **Identity Recovery**: Supporting DID recovery mechanisms for lost keys.
5. **Selective Disclosure**: Enabling selective disclosure of identity attributes for access control.

## Conclusion

The Identity-Integrated Storage System represents a significant advancement in the ICN Network's capabilities, providing a secure, user-centric approach to storage access control through the integration of decentralized identity. By combining DIDs, governance policies, and secure storage, we've created a system that enables fine-grained access control while maintaining user autonomy and privacy.
