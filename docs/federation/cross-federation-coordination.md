# Cross-Federation Coordination

The ICN Network implements a robust cross-federation coordination system that enables secure and efficient collaboration between different federations. This document describes the coordination system's architecture and features.

## Overview

The cross-federation coordination system provides:
- Federation registration and management
- Resource sharing agreements
- Trust-based collaboration
- Policy enforcement
- Dispute resolution

## Components

### 1. Federation Management

Each federation is represented by a `FederationInfo` structure containing:
- Unique identifier
- Name and description
- Member list (DIDs)
- Shared resources
- Governance policies
- Trust score
- Activity tracking
- Custom metadata

### 2. Federation Policies

Policies define the rules and constraints for federation interactions:

#### Resource Sharing Policies
```rust
PolicyType::ResourceSharing {
    max_share_percentage: f64,
    priority_levels: Vec<String>,
}
```
- Controls resource allocation between federations
- Defines sharing limits and priorities
- Ensures fair resource distribution

#### Governance Participation
```rust
PolicyType::GovernanceParticipation {
    voting_weight: f64,
    proposal_rights: Vec<String>,
}
```
- Defines voting power in cross-federation decisions
- Specifies proposal submission rights
- Controls governance participation levels

#### Trust Management
```rust
PolicyType::TrustManagement {
    min_trust_score: f64,
    reputation_factors: Vec<String>,
}
```
- Sets minimum trust requirements
- Defines reputation calculation factors
- Manages trust score evolution

#### Dispute Resolution
```rust
PolicyType::DisputeResolution {
    resolution_methods: Vec<String>,
    arbitrators: Vec<String>,
}
```
- Specifies conflict resolution procedures
- Defines arbitration mechanisms
- Lists approved arbitrators

### 3. Federation Agreements

Agreements formalize relationships between federations:

```rust
pub struct FederationAgreement {
    pub id: String,
    pub federation_a: String,
    pub federation_b: String,
    pub shared_resources: Vec<SharedResource>,
    pub shared_policies: Vec<FederationPolicy>,
    pub status: AgreementStatus,
    pub valid_until: u64,
}
```

#### Agreement Lifecycle
1. **Proposal**: Federation initiates agreement
2. **Review**: Both federations evaluate terms
3. **Activation**: Both parties approve and activate
4. **Monitoring**: Continuous compliance checking
5. **Suspension/Termination**: Handle violations or expiration

### 4. Resource Sharing

Shared resources are managed with detailed controls:

```rust
pub struct SharedResource {
    pub resource_id: String,
    pub share_percentage: f64,
    pub priority_access: bool,
    pub usage_limits: ResourceUsageLimits,
}
```

#### Usage Limits
```rust
pub struct ResourceUsageLimits {
    pub max_concurrent_allocations: u32,
    pub max_duration_per_allocation: u64,
    pub max_total_duration_per_day: u64,
    pub restricted_hours: Vec<u32>,
}
```

## Implementation

### Federation Coordinator

The `FederationCoordinator` manages all cross-federation interactions:

1. **Federation Registration**
```rust
pub async fn register_federation(
    &self,
    name: &str,
    description: &str,
    members: Vec<String>,
    policies: Vec<FederationPolicy>,
    metadata: serde_json::Value,
) -> Result<String, Box<dyn Error>>
```

2. **Agreement Management**
```rust
pub async fn propose_agreement(
    &self,
    federation_a: &str,
    federation_b: &str,
    shared_resources: Vec<SharedResource>,
    shared_policies: Vec<FederationPolicy>,
    valid_duration: u64,
) -> Result<String, Box<dyn Error>>
```

3. **Trust Management**
```rust
pub async fn update_trust_score(
    &self,
    federation_id: &str,
    interaction_score: f64,
) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Creating a Federation Agreement

```rust
// Register federations
let federation_a = coordinator.register_federation(
    "Federation A",
    "First federation",
    vec!["member1"],
    policies,
    metadata,
).await?;

// Propose agreement
let agreement_id = coordinator.propose_agreement(
    &federation_a,
    &federation_b,
    shared_resources,
    shared_policies,
    duration,
).await?;

// Activate agreement
coordinator.activate_agreement(&agreement_id, &federation_a).await?;
```

### 2. Managing Resource Sharing

```rust
// Define shared resources
let shared_resources = vec![
    SharedResource {
        resource_id: "resource-1",
        share_percentage: 0.3,
        priority_access: false,
        usage_limits: ResourceUsageLimits {
            max_concurrent_allocations: 5,
            max_duration_per_allocation: 3600,
            max_total_duration_per_day: 86400,
            restricted_hours: vec![],
        },
    },
];

// Verify resource access
let has_access = coordinator.verify_resource_access(
    &federation_id,
    "resource-1",
).await?;
```

## Best Practices

1. **Federation Setup**
   - Define clear policies and limits
   - Set appropriate trust thresholds
   - Document governance procedures

2. **Agreement Management**
   - Regular agreement reviews
   - Monitor compliance
   - Update policies as needed

3. **Resource Sharing**
   - Set conservative initial limits
   - Monitor usage patterns
   - Adjust based on trust scores

4. **Trust Management**
   - Regular trust score updates
   - Document trust violations
   - Implement graduated responses

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**
   - Verify federation membership
   - Enforce resource limits
   - Monitor for abuse

2. **Trust System**
   - Use multiple trust factors
   - Implement trust score decay
   - Regular trust assessments

3. **Dispute Resolution**
   - Clear escalation paths
   - Documented procedures
   - Fair arbitration process

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Trust Models**
   - Multi-factor trust scoring
   - Machine learning for trust prediction
   - Reputation network analysis

2. **Dynamic Resource Sharing**
   - Automated limit adjustments
   - Usage pattern optimization
   - Predictive resource allocation

3. **Enhanced Governance**
   - Automated policy enforcement
   - Cross-federation voting systems
   - Smart contract integration
