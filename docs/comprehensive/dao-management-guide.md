# DAO Management System Guide

## Introduction

The ICN DAO Management System provides comprehensive tools for creating, managing, and governing Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) within the InterCooperative Network. This system is designed specifically for cooperative organizations, emphasizing democratic governance, transparent operations, and member participation.

This guide explains the architecture, functionality, and implementation of the DAO Management System.

## Core Concepts

### DAO Identity

In the ICN network, each DAO has a unique identity consisting of:

- A decentralized identifier (DID) that uniquely identifies the DAO
- Basic information about the DAO (name, creation date, etc.)
- A list of founding members
- Custom metadata

This identity serves as the foundation for all DAO operations and interactions with other network components.

### Governance Models

The DAO system supports various governance models to fit different cooperative structures:

1. **Consensus-based**: Decisions require a high level of agreement (e.g., 75%+)
2. **Majority-based**: Simple or super majority voting
3. **Role-based**: Different roles have different decision-making powers
4. **Liquid Democracy**: Members can delegate voting power
5. **Holacracy**: Self-organizing circles with distributed authority
6. **Custom**: Customized governance structures for specific needs

### Roles and Permissions

The system implements a robust role-based permission system:

- Roles define sets of permissions
- Members can have multiple roles
- Permissions control what actions members can perform
- Standard roles (admin, member) with ability to create custom roles

### Treasury Management

Each DAO can manage shared resources through its treasury:

- Linked account for collective resources
- Spending limits by role or amount
- Multi-signature approval for larger transactions
- Transparent transaction history

### Proposal Workflows

The DAO system features a flexible proposal system with customizable workflows:

- Multiple proposal templates for different decision types
- Customizable fields and requirements
- State-based workflows with transitions
- Voting and execution integration

## System Architecture

The DAO Management System integrates with other ICN components:

## Key Components

### DAO Manager

The DAO Manager is the central component that coordinates all DAO operations:

```rust
pub struct DaoManager {
    /// Registered DAOs
    daos: RwLock<HashMap<String, DaoIdentity>>,
    /// Governance models for DAOs
    governance_models: RwLock<HashMap<String, DaoGovernanceModel>>,
    /// Treasury accounts for DAOs
    treasury_accounts: RwLock<HashMap<String, String>>,
    /// Treasury policies for DAOs
    treasury_policies: RwLock<HashMap<String, TreasuryPolicy>>,
    /// Proposal templates for DAOs
    proposal_templates: RwLock<HashMap<String, HashMap<String, ProposalTemplate>>>,
    /// Roles for DAO members
    member_roles: RwLock<HashMap<String, HashMap<String, HashSet<String>>>>,
}
```

The DAO Manager provides methods for:
- Creating and registering DAOs
- Managing DAO membership
- Assigning and checking roles and permissions
- Configuring governance models
- Managing treasury accounts
- Handling proposal templates

### DAO Identity

The DAO Identity structure stores basic information about a DAO:

```rust
pub struct DaoIdentity {
    /// DID of the DAO
    pub did: String,
    /// Name of the DAO
    pub name: String,
    /// DIDs of founding members
    pub founding_members: Vec<String>,
    /// Creation timestamp
    pub created_at: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
    /// Last updated timestamp
    pub updated_at: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
    /// Metadata for the DAO
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

### Governance Model

The governance model defines how decisions are made within a DAO:

```rust
pub struct DaoGovernanceModel {
    /// Decision-making model
    pub decision_model: DecisionModel,
    /// Voting threshold for consensus
    pub consensus_threshold: f64,
    /// Whether vote delegation is enabled
    pub delegation_enabled: bool,
    /// Roles defined in the DAO
    pub roles: HashMap<String, DaoRole>,
    /// Minimum voting period
    pub min_voting_period: chrono::Duration,
    /// Maximum voting period
    pub max_voting_period: chrono::Duration,
    /// Quorum requirement as a percentage of members
    pub quorum_percentage: f64,
}
```

The system supports various decision models:

```rust
pub enum DecisionModel {
    /// Consensus-based decision making
    Consensus,
    /// Majority voting
    Majority,
    /// Role-based decision making
    RoleBased,
    /// Liquid democracy with delegation
    LiquidDemocracy,
    /// Holacracy-style governance
    Holacracy,
    /// Custom decision model
    Custom(String),
}
```

### Roles and Permissions

Roles define what members can do within a DAO:

```rust
pub struct DaoRole {
    /// Name of the role
    pub name: String,
    /// Permissions for this role
    pub permissions: Vec<DaoPermission>,
    /// Metadata for the role
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

The system supports various permissions:

```rust
pub enum DaoPermission {
    /// Manage roles (create, modify, delete)
    ManageRoles,
    /// Manage members (add, remove)
    ManageMembers,
    /// Manage governance (change rules)
    ManageGovernance,
    /// Manage treasury (spend funds)
    ManageTreasury,
    /// Create proposals and vote
    ProposeAndVote,
    /// Custom permission
    Custom(String),
}
```

### Proposal System

The proposal system manages decision-making processes:

```rust
pub struct ProposalTemplate {
    /// Name of the template
    pub name: String,
    /// Description of the template
    pub description: String,
    /// Fields required for this proposal type
    pub fields: Vec<ProposalField>,
    /// Workflow for this proposal type
    pub workflow: ProposalWorkflow,
    /// Metadata for the template
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

Proposals follow customizable workflows:

```rust
pub struct ProposalWorkflow {
    /// States in the workflow
    pub states: Vec<ProposalState>,
    /// Transitions between states
    pub transitions: Vec<ProposalTransition>,
    /// Initial state
    pub initial_state: String,
    /// Final states
    pub final_states: Vec<String>,
}
```

### Treasury Policy

The treasury policy controls how DAO resources are managed:

```rust
pub struct TreasuryPolicy {
    /// Spending limits by role or member
    pub spending_limits: HashMap<String, f64>,
    /// Approval thresholds by amount
    pub approval_thresholds: HashMap<String, f64>,
    /// Credit limit for the treasury
    pub credit_limit: f64,
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New DAO

```rust
// Create a DAO identity
let dao_identity = DaoIdentity::new(
    "did:icn:dao:example".to_string(),
    "Example Cooperative".to_string(),
    vec!["did:icn:member1".to_string(), "did:icn:member2".to_string()]
);

// Register the DAO
dao_manager.register_dao(dao_identity).await?;

// Set up a governance model
let governance_model = DaoGovernanceModel::consensus_based(0.75, true);
dao_manager.set_governance_model("did:icn:dao:example", governance_model).await?;

// Set up a treasury account
dao_manager.set_treasury_account("did:icn:dao:example", "acct:treasury123").await?;

// Set up a treasury policy
let policy = TreasuryPolicy {
    spending_limits: {
        let mut limits = HashMap::new();
        limits.insert("admin".to_string(), 1000.0);
        limits.insert("member".to_string(), 100.0);
        limits
    },
    approval_thresholds: {
        let mut thresholds = HashMap::new();
        thresholds.insert("small".to_string(), 0.5); // 50% approval for small amounts
        thresholds.insert("large".to_string(), 0.75); // 75% approval for large amounts
        thresholds
    },
    credit_limit: 10000.0,
};
dao_manager.set_treasury_policy("did:icn:dao:example", policy).await?;
```

### Managing Roles and Permissions

```rust
// Add a member to a role
dao_manager.add_member_to_role(
    "did:icn:dao:example", 
    "did:icn:new_member", 
    "member"
).await?;

// Check if a member has a specific role
let is_admin = dao_manager.has_role(
    "did:icn:dao:example",
    "did:icn:member1",
    "admin"
).await?;

// Check if a member has a specific permission
let can_manage_treasury = dao_manager.has_permission(
    "did:icn:dao:example",
    "did:icn:member1",
    &DaoPermission::ManageTreasury
).await?;
```

### Creating and Using Proposal Templates

```rust
// Create proposal templates
let templates = {
    let mut templates = HashMap::new();
    
    // Template for spending proposals
    templates.insert("spending_proposal".to_string(), ProposalTemplate {
        name: "Spending Proposal".to_string(),
        description: "Proposal to spend DAO funds".to_string(),
        fields: vec![
            ProposalField {
                name: "amount".to_string(),
                field_type: ProposalFieldType::Number,
                description: "Amount to spend".to_string(),
                required: true,
                default_value: None,
            },
            ProposalField {
                name: "recipient".to_string(),
                field_type: ProposalFieldType::Address,
                description: "Recipient of the funds".to_string(),
                required: true,
                default_value: None,
            },
            ProposalField {
                name: "purpose".to_string(),
                field_type: ProposalFieldType::Text,
                description: "Purpose of the spending".to_string(),
                required: true,
                default_value: None,
            },
        ],
        workflow: create_basic_workflow(),
        metadata: HashMap::new(),
    });
    
    templates
};

// Register the templates
dao_manager.register_proposal_templates(
    "did:icn:dao:example",
    templates
).await?;
```

## Integration with Other Components

### Integration with Identity System

The DAO Management System relies on the Identity System for:
- Authenticating members using DIDs
- Verifying role claims and permissions
- Issuing and verifying DAO-specific credentials

### Integration with Economic System

The DAO Management System connects with the Economic System for:
- Managing DAO treasury accounts
- Executing financial decisions from proposals
- Tracking resource allocation and usage

### Integration with Governance System

The DAO Management System integrates with the Governance System for:
- Conducting votes on proposals
- Implementing governance decisions
- Enforcing governance rules and policies

### Integration with Smart Contracts

The DAO Management System works with Smart Contracts to:
- Automate proposal execution
- Enforce treasury policies
- Implement complex governance rules

## Advanced Features

### Federation Support

DAOs can participate in federations with other DAOs:
- Shared governance across multiple DAOs
- Inter-DAO resource sharing
- Coordinated policy implementation
- Nested DAO structures

### Delegation and Liquid Democracy

The system supports advanced voting delegation:
- Members can delegate voting power to others
- Delegation can be for specific proposal types
- Delegation chains with transitive delegation
- Delegation impact visualization

### Multi-Stakeholder Governance

The system supports different stakeholder categories:
- Worker members
- Consumer members
- Supporter members
- Community members
- Each with appropriate voting weights and permissions

### Proposal Impact Analysis

For significant proposals, the system can:
- Simulate outcomes before execution
- Analyze impact on treasury and operations
- Compare with historical decisions
- Provide risk assessments

## Security Considerations

The DAO Management System implements several security features:

1. **Permission Enforcement**: Strict checking of permissions before any sensitive action
2. **Multi-signature Requirements**: Treasury operations above thresholds require multiple approvals
3. **Audit Logging**: All actions are logged for accountability
4. **Recovery Mechanisms**: Emergency procedures for critical situations
5. **Gradual Execution**: High-impact decisions can be implemented gradually

## Best Practices

When using the DAO Management System, consider these best practices:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with simpler governance models before advancing to complex ones
2. **Clear Roles**: Define clear roles with appropriate permissions
3. **Documentation**: Document governance procedures for members
4. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update governance models
5. **Training**: Ensure members understand how to participate effectively
6. **Transparency**: Make decision-making transparent to build trust
7. **Accessibility**: Ensure governance is accessible to all members

## Conclusion

The ICN DAO Management System provides cooperatives with powerful tools for self-governance that align with cooperative principles. By supporting various governance models, flexible role systems, and transparent resource management, the system enables cooperatives to implement their governance vision while benefiting from the technical capabilities of the ICN network.

The integration with other ICN components creates a cohesive environment where governance, identity, and economics work together to support cooperative organizations in a decentralized context.
