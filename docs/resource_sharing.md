## Cross-Federation Resource Sharing

The resource sharing system supports sharing resources between different federations through a controlled and secure mechanism. This functionality enables federations to collaborate while maintaining proper access controls and usage limits.

### Key Features

1. **Federation-to-Federation Agreements**
   - Federations can establish resource sharing agreements
   - Configurable resource share percentages
   - Customizable usage limits and restrictions
   - Optional priority access for critical workloads

2. **Usage Limits and Controls**
   - Maximum concurrent allocations
   - Maximum duration per allocation
   - Daily usage quotas
   - Restricted hours configuration
   - Share percentage limits

3. **Trust-Based Access**
   - Dynamic trust score updates based on resource usage patterns
   - Compliance monitoring for usage limits
   - Automatic trust score adjustments
   - Impact on future resource allocations

4. **ML-Optimized Resource Allocation**
   - Intelligent resource amount optimization
   - Duration optimization based on historical patterns
   - Priority-aware allocation strategies
   - Adaptive resource distribution

### Usage Example

```rust
// Request a resource from another federation
let allocation = resource_system.request_federation_resource(
    "compute-resource-1",
    100, // requested amount
    3600, // duration in seconds
    "federation-2", // requesting federation
    serde_json::json!({
        "purpose": "data processing",
        "priority": "normal"
    }),
).await?;

// Check allocation status
if allocation.status == AllocationStatus::Active {
    // Use the allocated resource
    // ...
}
```

### Federation Agreement Setup

```rust
// Create a resource sharing agreement
federation_coordinator.create_resource_agreement(
    "owner-federation",
    "consumer-federation",
    "resource-id",
    0.3, // 30% share
    ResourceUsageLimits {
        max_concurrent_allocations: 5,
        max_duration_per_allocation: 7200,
        max_total_duration_per_day: 86400,
        restricted_hours: vec![],
    },
    false, // no priority access
).await?;
```

### Usage Monitoring and Trust Updates

The system automatically monitors resource usage patterns and updates trust scores based on:
- Adherence to usage limits
- Resource utilization efficiency
- Allocation duration compliance
- Overall behavior patterns

### Best Practices

1. **Resource Sharing Agreements**
   - Start with conservative share percentages
   - Gradually increase based on trust and usage patterns
   - Set appropriate usage limits based on resource capacity
   - Consider time zone differences for restricted hours

2. **Resource Requests**
   - Request reasonable amounts and durations
   - Include relevant metadata for tracking
   - Handle allocation failures gracefully
   - Monitor and release unused allocations

3. **Trust Management**
   - Maintain good usage patterns
   - Respect usage limits
   - Release resources promptly when done
   - Document resource usage purposes

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use the ML optimizer for better resource utilization
   - Monitor usage patterns for optimization opportunities
   - Consider priority access for critical workloads
   - Balance between different federation needs

### Error Handling

The system provides specific error types for different scenarios:
- `ResourceSharingError::Unauthorized`: Federation doesn't have access
- `ResourceSharingError::UsageLimitExceeded`: Usage limits reached
- `ResourceSharingError::ResourceUnavailable`: Resource not available
- `ResourceSharingError::InvalidRequest`: Invalid request parameters

### Integration with ML Optimizer

The cross-federation resource sharing system integrates with the ML optimizer to:
1. Predict optimal resource amounts
2. Optimize allocation durations
3. Learn from usage patterns
4. Adapt to changing workloads

### Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Trust Metrics**
   - Multi-dimensional trust scoring
   - Federation reputation system
   - Historical performance analysis
   - Peer recommendations

2. **Dynamic Resource Sharing**
   - Automatic share adjustments
   - Demand-based allocation
   - Time-based sharing policies
   - Resource exchange mechanisms

3. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Real-time usage analytics
   - Performance metrics
   - Compliance reporting
   - Anomaly detection
